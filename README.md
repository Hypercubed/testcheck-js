Generative property testing for Jasmine
=======================================

`jasmine-check` adds the generative testing power of `testcheck-js` to Jasmine.
This allows some of your Jasmine tests to accept arguments and ensure your tests
pass not just under your contrived test cases but also pass for hundreds of
randomly generated test cases.


Getting started
---------------

Install `jasmine-check` using npm.

```shell
npm install jasmine-check
```

Then include and install `jasmine-check` in a spec.

```javascript
require('jasmine-check').install();
```
